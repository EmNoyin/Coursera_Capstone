Nieuwegein was a small town that has been transformed into one of the big residential area of Utrecht, as this nearby city grew and started expanding into the pre-existing villages and towns areas.

Utrecht is an University city with a lot of different entertainment and food options. On the other hand the property prices in Utrecht both for rent and purchase are much above the ones in her nearby residential areas as Nieuwegein, De Meern, etc.

In this report we will analyze:
- The difference in supply quality and quantity of restaurants in Nieuwegein in comparison with Utrecht.
